<h3>A Duck</h3>
<img class="img-rounded" alt=" photo close-up of a duck" src="//images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/125/cache/funny-duck_12551_600x450.jpg" />
<p>I caught this mandarin drake as I was sitting next to a pond at the San Diego Zoo. After setting up shots all over the zoo, I just focused and snapped the photo. It turned out to be the best photo of the day! </p>
